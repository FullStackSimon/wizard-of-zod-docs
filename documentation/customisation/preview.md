# Preview

## Overview

After completing all forms and ensuring all fields are valid, users are presented with a **Preview** screen. This allows them to review their inputs and make any necessary amendments before final submission.

## Choosing a Preview Type

The wizard supports a configurable [preview](../api/props.html#preview) prop, which determines how the preview is displayed. The available options are:

| Option      | Description                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `'cards'`   | Displays preview data in a card-based layout (default).                     |
| `'list'`    | Shows preview data in a simple list format.                                 |
| `'table'`   | Structures preview data in a tabular format for a more structured view.     |

### Example Usage

To specify a preview type, set the `preview` prop:

```vue
<Wizard preview="cards" />
```

or:

```vue
<Wizard preview="list" />
```

To use a table-based preview:

```vue
<Wizard preview="table" />
```

## Built-in Preview Types

### Cards Preview (Default)
The **cards** preview displays each formâ€™s data in a separate card with structured content. Users can see their answers grouped neatly with titles and descriptions.

### List Preview
The **list** preview presents each question and answer in a straightforward, readable format. It is useful for minimalistic designs where compactness is preferred.

### Table Preview
The **table** preview organizes form data into a structured table layout, making it easier to scan large amounts of information at a glance.

## Conclusion

The [preview](../api/props.html#preview) prop provides flexibility in presenting user-entered data before final submission. Whether using the default **cards**, **list**, or **table** preview, **Wizard of Zod** ensures a seamless review process before submission.
