# Project Documentation

This repository contains the source files for our documentation site built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/).

## Development

If you'd like to run the site locally:

npm run docs:dev
```

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute (thank you!) follow the same process as described when contributing to the package repo itself [here](https://fullstacksimon.github.io/wizard-of-zod-docs/documentation/guide/contributing.html) - but obviously use the correct repo!
